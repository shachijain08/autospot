        Windows allow the driver and passenger to see outside the car while in the vehicle.
        
        Problems:
        Broken - If a window on your car is broken, you will need to get it replaced as soon as possible. In the meantime, remove as much of the broken glass as possible. Wear protective gloves and eyewear to pick up large glass pieces and use a vacuum to vacuum away any smaller pieces that you find. Make sure to collect glass from both the inside and outside of your car. Next, dampen a soft cloth with water and wipe down the window seal and frame area. Finally, get clear packing tape and seal the window. Start on one side of the window in the inside of the car and run strips vertically across the opening of the window. If you don’t have packing tape, then cardboard can also work but packing tape is more ideal as it has a stronger seal.
