        Disk Brakes:
    </h1>
    <p>
        
        Disc brakes main purpose is to stop the vehicle. They have three main parts: brake pads, a caliper, and a rotor. The brake pads push against the rotor to stop the wheel which stops the vehicle. 
        Problems:
        Brake light on - If your brake light is on then it could mean that there is an issue with your disc brakes It is recommended that you take a look at your vehicle for regular maintenance as well as check the disc brakes and ensure that they are working properly.
        Squealing or squeaking noise - If your brakes are making new noises then it could be a potential issue. It could be a foreign object lodged somewhere in your brakes or could be your brake-pad indicators. Check your brakes to ensure that nothing is lodged in your breaks. If nothing is, then it is recommended you take your car to a mechanic or service shop in order to replace your brake pads. 
        Grinding noise - If you feel or hear any form of braking in your car, you should take your car to a mechanic or service shop as soon as possible. This could mean that your brakes need servicing right away due to either the brake pad or shoe scraping on metal contact points.
        Wobbling or vibrating when braking - if your steering wheel or vehicle shakes whenever your brake it could mean that the thickness of your rotor is uneven. Most likely, a mechanic or service shop will have to look at your rotor to determine if it’s uneven and possibly replace it.
