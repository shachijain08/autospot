        Battery:

Your car battery provides the electricity needed to make your car run. It also converts chemical energy into the electrical energy that delivers voltage to its starter. It also stabilizes voltage which keeps your engine running.
Problems:
Clicking Sound - A clicking sound when you turn the key most likely means that the battery does not have enough power. This could be due to incomplete charging by the alternator. It could also be due to a faulty starter solenoid or relay that isn't able to supply enough power to the starter. The best solution is to take your vehicle to a mechanic or service shop as soon as you are able to.
Corrosion -  Colored, fuzzy build up can indicate battery corrosion. This could be a leak which is contributing to poor performance. Regular battery maintenance is recommended to avoid this problem. 
Dead battery regularly - In very hot and very cold conditions car batteries can often fail to start, however if it’s failing regularly that’s a cause for concern. Check that none of your accessories have been left on due to an ignition switch. Bad alternators and regulators could cause a faulty ignition switch. The best solution is to take your vehicle to a mechanic or service shop to get this checked out if you are not able to tell yourself.
Intermediate starting - If your car sometimes fails to start and sometimes starts perfectly fine then that could be an issue with your battery. Specifically your battery terminals could have issues. The most common issues are that they could be loose, broken, corroded, or calcified. The best solution is to take your car to a mechanic or service shop so that they can check your battery terminals.
Dim lights - if your car lights fade as the car runs or are dimmer than usual then there could be an issue with your battery or alternator. Check that the battery has enough voltage. If the voltage is below 13.5 then the alternator likely can not keep up with the battery. If the voltage is above 13.5 and less than 15 then there could be an issue with your battery.
