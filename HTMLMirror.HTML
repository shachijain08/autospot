        Rearview Mirror:
    </h1>
    <p>
        
        The rearview mirror is located on the upper part of the windshield. Its main purpose is to reflect the surroundings behind the vehicle which allows the driver to see nearby vehicles as well as determine when it is safe to change lanes. 
        
        Problems:
        Auto dimming does not work - The sensors could be off or not working properly. Take a soft cloth and clean the sensors located on the back of the mirror. Make sure to wipe gently so that you do not accidentally scratch the sensors. Ensure that nothing is blocking the sensors from receiving light as well. Afterwards, shine a flashlight on the sensors to see if the mirror dims. If it does not dim then your rearview mirror could be going bad and may need to be replaced soon.
        Discoloration - Debris and sunlight can cause rearview mirrors to become discolored over time. Take a soft cloth and try to clean it. Make sure to wipe gently so that you do not accidentally scratch the sensors. If that does not work, then the discoloration could be below the surface of the mirror, and the mirror has more than likely been damaged and needs to be replaced.
        No rearview mirror - Rearview mirrors can fall or break off of their mounts in accidents. If you are missing a rearview mirror then it needs to be replaced as soon as possible. Not just for your own safety, but also to avoid any possible legal fees. Many states have laws requiring a rearview mirror.
